            <p id="intro">Harry Styles is teasing a new album with billboards around the world. This will be his fourth
                studio album, after his 2022 Grammy-winning album, “Harry’s House.”</p>

            <p>The 31-year-old singer has been hinting at a comeback since publishing a <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaMtVAqJzOs">YouTube video</a> on December 27 titled,
                “Forever, forever.” The video shows footage from Styles’ final show of his 2023 tour, ending with the
                message, “We belong together.”</p>

            <p>On Monday morning, posters with this phrase were seen in cities including:</p>
